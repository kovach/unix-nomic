* unix-nomic

  This is the core functionality of a nomic which *is* a functioning
  unix system.  Proposals are pieces of code which are to be run by
  the root user.

* Installation

  The nomic is designed to be used on Ubuntu Server 14.04.1 LTS.

  Once there is such a system running, the bootstrap.sh script should
  be run by hand.

  It may be necessary to disable ipv6. Add to sysctl.conf:
  #+BEGIN_SRC
    net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.default.disable_ipv6 = 1
    net.ipv6.conf.lo.disable_ipv6 = 1
  #+END_SRC
  Then run ~sudo sysctl -p~ or reboot.
